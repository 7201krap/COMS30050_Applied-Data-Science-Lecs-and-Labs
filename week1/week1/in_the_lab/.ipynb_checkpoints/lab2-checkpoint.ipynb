    "# The Guardian API\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `05_web_scraping_beautiful_soup.ipynb` notebook, we saw examples on how BeautifulSoup can be used \n",
    "to parse messy HTML, to extract information, and to act as a rudimentary web crawler. \n",
    "We used The Guardian as an illustrative example about how this can be achieved. \n",
    "The reason for choosing The Guardian was because they provide a REST API to their servers. \n",
    "With the REST API it is possible to perform specific queries on their servers, and to receive \n",
    "current information from their servers according to their API guide (ie in JSON)\n",
    "\n",
    "http://open-platform.theguardian.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use their API, you will need to register for an API key. \n",
    "At the time of writing (Jan 28, 2020) this was an automated process that can be completed at \n",
    "\n",
    "https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer\n",
    "\n",
    "On registration you will receive an API key which will look like: 303qwe2k-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-eff86a248059\n",
    "\n",
    "The API is documented here: \n",
    "\n",
    "http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/\n",
    "\n",
    "and Python bindings to their API are provided by The Guardian here\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/prabhath6/theguardian-api-python\n",
    "\n",
    "and these can easily be integrated into a web-crawler based on API calls, rather than being based \n",
    "on HTML parsing, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use four parameters in our queries here: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `section`: the section of the newspaper that we are interested in querying. In this case we will look at \n",
    "the technology section \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `order-by`: We have specified that the newest items should be closer to the front of the query list \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `api-key`: In this notebook, the api-key is left as `test` (works here), but for *real* deployment of such a spider an API key obtained from Guardian should be specified. For the lab tasks, you should replace `test` API key with your personal API key. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `page-size`: The number of results to return. "

      " a poorly explained update to its terms of service has pushed whatsapp users to adopt alternative services such as signal and telegram in their millions the exodus was so large that whatsapp has been forced to delay the implementation of the new terms which had been slated for  february and run a damage limitation campaign to explain to users the changes they were making over the first three weeks of january signal has gained  million users globally according to figures shared by the uk parliaments home affairs committee and telegram has gained  million in both cases the increase appears to have come at whatsapps expense data tracked by the analytics firm app annie shows whatsapp falling from the eighth most downloaded app in the uk at the beginning of the month to the rd by  january by contrast signal wasnt even in the top  apps in the uk on  january yet by  january it was the most downloaded app in the country niamh sweeney whatsapps director of public policy for europe the middle east and africa told the home affairs committee that the exodus was believed to be related to the update to the companys terms of service she said that update was intended to do two things enable a new set of features around business messaging and make clarifications and provide greater transparency around the companys preexisting policies there are no changes to our data sharing with facebook anywhere in the world sweeney said but after viral posts  ironically widely spread on whatsapp  claimed that the privacy policy instead gave the service the right to read users messages and hand the information over to its parent company facebook whatsapp announced a delay in the implementation of the new terms of service we want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way whatsapp said in an update posted to its site which it is paying to advertise on google under searches for whatsapp privacy policy the company says it will delay the implementation of its new policy until  may app annies director of market insights amir ghodrati said moving quickly was important these types of shifts in messaging and social networking apps are not unusual due to the nature of social apps and how the primary functionality involves communicating with others their growth can often move quite quickly based on current events weve seen growing demand over the last few years for encrypted messaging and apps focused on privacy the shift to more privacyfocused messaging apps had been building before whatsapps public relations disaster ghodrati said messaging apps that provide privacy features saw the greatest engagement growth in the first half of  these apps saw on average  more active users than the alternatives apps like signal telegram wickr and whatsapp offer privacy features ranging from endtoend encrypted data transfer to selfdestructing messages ironically in some ways whatsapp is more privacyfocused than its competitor telegram the former applies endtoend encryption  which prevents the service provider from being able to access user messages  by default to every chat except those between users and large businesses telegram however only turns on endtoend encryption for secret chats an option that users must actively select for each individual contact such chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella the service explains in an faq \n",

threatening to stop using the service whatsapp soon issued a clarification explaining that the new policy only affects the way users accounts interact with businesses ie not with their friends and does not mandate any new data collection the messaging app also delayed the introduction of the policy by three months crucially whatsapp said the new policy doesnt affect the content of your chats

mitnick says he has never communicated a secure message over whatsapp while choosing a messaging service is an important choice there are other ways you can ensure your digital security here are mitnicks top five tips for protecting your privacy online  use a password manager mitnick says the future of security is passwordfree with solutions such as trusona doing away with usernames and passwords in favour of qr codes and twofactor authentication but until that technology is widespread a password manager is the number one tool mitnick recommends make your master password a full sentence with all the spaces and correct capitalisation such as i went to byron bay today the password manager will do the heavy lifting from there every time you visit a site it will either autofill your existing password or if its a new site create a strong password for you password managers can also scan your current passwords for weaknesses and recommend stronger versions that conform with randomness when choosing a password manager go for australian uk or us companies and avoid those based out of russia or china mitnick says its also better to choose a product that has lots of users like lastpass and one password because its more likely any vulnerabilities will be picked up quickly  implement twofactor authentication twofactor authentication or multifactor authentication is a signin method that requires two or more pieces of evidence of your identity to enable login the first piece is usually a username and password and the second might be an sms or an app such as google authenticator or authy you might find sms more convenient but an authenticator app is much more secure if you need even more security you can use a yubikey  a usb authentication device you plug into

the purpose since it will have access to all your browsing data things to consider when choosing a service include how many people use it more is better and where the company and its servers are located aim for five eyes countries australia canada new zealand the uk and the us  do security awareness training mitnick says everyone should undertake good security awareness training which will help you understand how you as a consumer could be compromised there are security courses available for free online that walk you through different areas of consumerbased security including passwords online banking avoiding malware keeping your personal information confidential protecting your kids online and securing your home network email and attachments   keep your financial transactions

internet opening files people send you playing games the computer youre using has a high risk of being compromised without you realising it  even if youre using antivirus software mitnick suggests buying an ipad or cheap tablet to use exclusively for financial transactions he also suggests creating a separate account in your password manager with a distinct master password to store your

      " apple has criticised facebook for trying to collect as much data as possible from users saying it will push ahead with its planned launch of a new privacy feature despite objections from the advertising industry the companys director of global privacy jane horvath made the criticism in a letter to a coalition of privacy groups reassuring them that the feature which will require users to actively allow developers to track how they use other apps would still be launched we developed app tracking transparency for a single reason because we share your concerns about users being tracked without their consent and the bundling and reselling of data by advertising networks and data brokers horvath wrote she defended apples approach to targeted adverts which she said was based on demographic details rather than user tracking facebook and others have a very different approach to targeting horvath wrote not only do they allow the grouping of users into smaller segments they use detailed data about online browsing activity to target ads facebook executives have made clear their intent is to collect as much data as possible across both first and third party products to develop and monetise detailed profiles of their users and this disregard for user privacy continues to expand to include more of their products the claim drew a strong rebuke from facebook which accused apple if using their dominant market position to selfpreference their own data collection while making it nearly impossible for their competitors to use the same data they claim its about privacy but its about profit the company said the att feature which is expected to be launched in early  has sparked a wave of controversy since apple announced its plans in july when it is enabled any app running on iphones or ipads will need to ask users permission before accessing particular data that can be used to track them across other apps this data is called the identifier for advertisers and the advertising industry fears users will refuse permission harming its ability to personalise adverts in september apple agreed to delay the introduction of att to give the industry more time to prepare that delay prompted another outcry from the privacy campaigners horvath addressed in apples letter on friday the ranking digital rights campaign a coalition including access now amnesty international and the electronic frontier foundation said these features will constitute a vital policy improvement with the potential to strengthen respect for privacy across the industry apple should implement these features as expeditiously as possible apple has faced a separate complaint based on the very existence of the id for advertisers in a privacy case filed on monday the consumer rights activist max schrems argued that the tracking capabilities violate privacy regulations  and would continue to do so even after apples planned changes were implemented\n",

      " the consumer rights activist max schrems has filed a formal privacy case against apple arguing that an id generated by iphones that lets advertisers track users violates privacy regulations schrems whose lawsuit against facebook led to a landmark ruling restricting data transfers from the eu to the us has made the case through his privacy rights nonprofit noyb which has filed formal complaints in spain and berlin against apple at the core of the complaint is apples generation of the idfa identifier for advertisers on each iphone advertisers can then use the idfa to track users across various apps and better target them for personalised advertising the idea behind the tool is to improve user privacy by stopping advertisers using other identifiers to track users and allowing users to reset the idfa at will but noyb argues simply generating it could breach eu privacy law since it is created without the users knowledge or consent and while users are given control over whether they reset the identifier and allowed to prevent individual apps from accessing it they cannot noyb says prevent it from being generated in the first place eu law protects our devices from external tracking said stefano rossetti a privacy lawyer at noyb tracking is only allowed if users explicitly consent to it this very simple rule applies regardless of the tracking technology used while apple introduced functions in its browser to block cookies it places similar codes in its phones without any consent by the user this is a clear breach of eu privacy laws with our complaints we want to enforce a simple principle trackers are illegal unless a user freely consents the idfa should not only be restricted but permanently deleted smartphones are the most intimate device for most people and they must be trackerfree by default in a statement apple strongly denied noybs complaints had merit the claims made against apple in this complaint are factually inaccurate and we look forward to making that clear to privacy regulators should they examine the complaint apple does not access or use the idfa on a users device for any purpose our aim is always to protect the privacy of our users and our latest software release ios  is giving users even greater control over whether or not they want to allow apps to track them by linking their information with data from third parties for the purpose of advertising or sharing their information with data brokers our practices comply with european law and support and advance the aims of the gdpr and the eprivacy directive which is to give people full control over their data although much of the eus privacy law is regulated by gdpr general data protection regulation which would place the power to act in the hands of the irish data protection authority based on the location of the companys eu hq noybs complaint is based on the older eprivacy directive that means that germany or spain could decide to directly fine apple if they agree with the criticism despite the privacy complaint apple has more frequently faced criticism over its idfa feature from the other side of the divide advertisers panicked when early beta versions of ios  the latest operating system for iphones required an active warning before developers could read the idfa  and offered users the ability to not share it that feature was pulled at the last minute and will now not be live until \n",

millions of views and likes but with the chineseowned app now under fire over data privacy concerns sparrow  and other young users have reacted with a resounding shrug    im so used to all social networks having my data that i feel its just the price i have to pay to connect with others  mauren sparrow tiktok user     i dont really care that these corporations have my data as long as i know they have it sparrow says at this point im so used to all social networks having all of my data that i feel its just the price i have to pay to connect with others tiktoks future has been in flux for weeks after the us secretary of state mike pompeo hinted at a potential ban in early july most recently donald trump approved of microsofts efforts to acquire a part of tiktoks business but only if the deal was completed by  september a price has not yet been arrived at but could top bn threats of action against the app  which some us authorities fear could share user data with the chinese government  sent shockwaves through the tiktok community with many content creators rushing to launch live streams to direct followers to alternative platforms videos reacting to the potential ban ranged from technical tips on how to evade it to anger at trump to indifference over data privacy  am i the only one who doesnt care if china collects my data a user in one viral video stated let the chinese government have my data they know me better than i know myself another joked tiktok is one of the worlds most popular apps and has been downloaded roughly bn times meaning a ban would not be easy or popular fortyseven per cent of millennials and  of gen z  the biggest demographic on the platform  said the app should not be banned meanwhile  of gen z users said they would be more likely to use tiktok if the us banned it just  said a ban would make them less likely to use it according to a us survey from the market research firm morning consult   related should you delete tiktok heres what experts say about the app trump wants to ban    i think that there would be a riot if tiktok were somehow truly banned in this country sparrow said the debate over tiktoks future has also underscored the generational divide between the lawmakers legislating technology platforms and the people who use them for gen z which has grown up on facebook snapchat and instagram having their personal data collected is a given tiktok in particular thrives on oversharing with young people using music to share embarrassing stories and photos of themselves to the tune of millions of likes and comments some of you are too comfortable on here is a common refrain in the comments of videos on a more fundamental level most do not believe they have the choice to opt out of data collection said josh golin the executive director of the nonprofit campaign for a commercial free childhood  if you gave most young people a choice between protecting their privacy by getting off social media or staying on social media they will stay he said but what if you had a choice to be both on social media and have your privacy protected with a historic hearing involving big tech firms last month and new data privacy laws in california and europe there have been incremental steps towards that goal but many users are not in a hurry to force companies to change their data practices studies show gen z is more tolerant of targeted advertising and less bothered by surveillance while  of gen x and  of millennials are concerned companies will use their data against them just  of gen z is worried according to a  survey from the marketing firm mobile marketer    it feels ridiculous to worry about china when it seems everyone is literally recording us as we grow up  annie yearold tiktok user     annie a yearold tiktok user who downloaded the app to pass the time during quarantine and now uses it daily said she finds the us governments focus on china ridiculous when us companies do the same our personal data is collected by endless amounts of private corporations who just sell our details to the highest bidder said annie who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her privacy it feels a bit ridiculous to worry solely about china when it seems everyone is literally recording us as we grow up a spokeswoman from tiktok told the guardian the companys security team was led by an experienced usbased chief information security officer with decades of industry and us law enforcement experience all us user data was stored in the us she added with strict controls on employee access the company has also released a series of informational videos on the app about how to keep user data private and secure     while legislators worry young users remain defiant about their plans to stay on the platform photograph rishi dekazuma wirerexshutterstock    protecting the privacy of our users data is critical to tiktok she said we know its not enough to build strong security protections were also educating our community tiktok does collect user data but not significantly more than many usbased apps while there are some legitimate concerns about the app  such as whether its content could be influenced by censorship in china or how securely the platform is coded  some have speculated that trump is targeting tiktok in retaliation for his tulsa rally during which tiktok users organized campaigns to book tickets en masse then fail to show up leaving thousands of seats empty  stunts like these coupled with the apps popularity in an election year could make tiktok seem like a threat to the administration said ari lightman a professor of digital media and marketing at carnegie mellon university there is a conservative side of tiktok but the use of the platform for organizing activating the masses and doing things to mess with the trump administration is apparent he said but while legislators continue to fret young users remain defiant about their plans to stay on the platform nicole a yearold who lives in san diego and uses tiktok as much as five hours a day said she used it to stay connected with friends  especially during the pandemic i wouldnt leave even if trump tried to ban it she said her algorithm was geared toward her interests in spirituality motivational videos and comedy and said tiktok has allowed people from different parts of the world to connect in ways i didnt think was possible it made us realize things we thought made us strange or weird were more common than what we thought it is a place where you can find other people think like you\n",

      " a us senate bill that critics say would enable widespread censorship and surveillance has taken a significant step towards becoming law raising alarm among internet freedom advocates the senate judiciary committee voted on thursday to advance the earn it act legislation that on paper is intended to address sexual exploitation however privacy experts say the act would give the department of justice unprecedented power over the internet and potentially threaten the privacy of messages sent online  the eliminating abuse and rampant neglect of interactive technology earn it act was introduced in march by the south carolina republican lindsey graham democrat richard blumenthal of connecticut republican josh hawley of missouri and democrat dianne feinstein of california to address what lawmakers characterized as the rapid increase of child sexual abuse material on prominent online platforms technological advances have allowed the online exploitation of children to become much much worse over recent years said feinstein companies must do more to combat this growing problem on their online platforms the bill would weaken protections under section  a measure that has historically shielded internet publishers from legal responsibility for the content shared on their sites it would also allow individuals to sue tech companies that dont take proper steps to prevent online child exploitation those steps would be determined by a member panel of unelected officials mostly law enforcement who would impose a set of best practices that websites and online forums would have to follow or risk getting shut down the earn it act is supported by antiexploitation groups including the national center for missing amp exploited children ncmec rightsgirls and the national center on sexual exploitation but privacy advocates are concerned its powers could overreach and pose a threat to encryption a tool that obscures the content of messages so others  including tech companies and law enforcement  cannot read them if technology companies are to be held liable for content on their sites the privacy advocates say they could be required to scan all user messages requiring a weakening of encryption practices the earn it act could end user privacy as we know it said the electronic frontier foundation tech companies that provide private encrypted messaging could have to rewrite their software to allow police special access to their users messages grahams office did not return request for comment but it previously said his goal here is not to outlaw encryption  that will be a debate for another day however barr  who would be given a large amount of power under the new act  has been outspoken about his desire to force technology companies to allow law enforcement to bypass encryption the earn it act is being compared to the online sex trafficking act fosta and the stop enabling sex trafficking act sesta passed in  to combat online sex trafficking by making websites criminally liable for users content sestafosta had a chilling effect on internet platforms and put sex workers and members of the lgbtq community in danger critics said by forcing them offline as a result of the acts craigslist had to remove its personals ads section the website backpagecom a classifieds website with a large sex worker presence was shut down and social media platforms had to crack down on adult content critics argue the legislation broadly censored online speech and negatively affected people who engage in consensual sex work ultimately helping sex traffickers by pushing the industry underground similarly the earn it act would undermine the privacy of every single american and stifle our ability to communicate freely online the aclu said in a letter urging senators to vote no on the bill advocates fear the commission created by the earn it act would recommend best practices required by tech companies that disproportionately censor content relating to lgbtq matters sex work and the sex industry our online freedoms are now in serious jeopardy said kate ruane aclu senior legislative counsel in response to the senate judiciary committees vote in recent days the judiciary committee has tried to sidestep growing opposition to the bill by introducing amendments that are intended to address the concerns but utterly fail to do so said evan greer of internet freedoms group fight for the future a sneaky bill just got even sneakier she said if they move ahead with this deeply flawed bill theyll be ignoring the voices of experts and the public the bill will now head for a vote on the senate floor where it could potentially see a vote in the next few weeks before the chambers session ends on  july\n",

      " in the spring as the virus swept across the world and billions of people were compelled to stay at home the popularity of one social media app rose more sharply than any other by late march usage of whatsapp around the world had grown by  in spain where the lockdown was particularly strict it rose by  in those early months whatsapp  which hovers neatly between the space of email facebook and sms allowing text messages links and photos to be shared between groups  was a prime conduit through which waves of news memes and mass anxiety travelled   related whats wrong with whatsapp  podcast    at first many of the new uses were heartening mutual aid groups sprung up to help the vulnerable families and friends used the app to stay close sharing their fears and concerns in real time yet by midapril the role that whatsapp was playing in the pandemic looked somewhat darker a conspiracy theory about the rollout of g which originated long before covid had appeared now claimed that mobile phone masts were responsible for the disease across the uk people began setting fire to g masts with  arson attacks over the easter weekend alone whatsapp along with facebook and youtube was a key channel through which the conspiracy theory proliferated some feared that the very same community groups created during march were now accelerating the spread of the g conspiracy theory meanwhile the app was also enabling the spread of fake audio clips such as a widely shared recording in which someone who claimed to work for the nhs reported that ambulances would no longer be sent to assist people with breathing difficulties this was not the first time that whatsapp has been embroiled in controversy while the fake news scandals surrounding the  electoral upsets in the uk and us were more focused upon facebook  which owns whatsapp  subsequent electoral victories for jair bolsonaro in brazil and narendra modi in india were aided by incendiary whatsapp messaging exploiting the vast reach of the app in these countries in india there have also been reports of riots and at least  deaths linked to rumours circulating on whatsapp indias ministry of information and broadcasting has sought ways of regulating whatsapp content though this has led to new controversies about government infringement on civil liberties     brazils president jair bolsonaro with a printout of an opponents whatsapp message about him photograph ueslei marcelinoreuters    as ever there is a risk of pinning too much blame for complex political crises on an inert technology whatsapp has also taken some steps to limit its use as a vehicle for misinformation in march a whatsapp spokesperson told the washington post that the company had engaged health ministries around the world to provide simple ways for citizens to receive accurate information about the virus but even away from such visible disruptions whatsapp does seem to be an unusually effective vehicle for sowing distrust in public institutions and processes a whatsapp group can exist without anyone outside the group knowing of its existence who its members are or what is being shared while endtoend encryption makes it immune to surveillance from third parties back in britains precovid days when brexit and jeremy corbyn were the issues that provoked the most feverish political discussions speculation and paranoia swirled around such groups media commentators who defended corbyn were often accused of belonging to a whatsapp group of outriders coordinated by corbyns office which supposedly told them what line to take meanwhile the conservative partys probrexit european research group was said to be chiefly sustained in the form of a whatsapp group whose membership was never public secretive coordination  both real and imagined  does not strengthen confidence in democracy whatsapp groups can not only breed suspicion among the public but also manufacture a mood of suspicion among their own participants as also demonstrated by closed facebook groups discontents  not always wellfounded  accumulate in private before boiling over in public the capacity to circulate misinformation and allegations is becoming greater than the capacity to resolve them the political threat of whatsapp is the flipside of its psychological appeal unlike so many other social media platforms whatsapp is built to secure privacy on the plus side this means intimacy with those we care about and an ability to speak freely on the negative side it injects an ethos of secrecy and suspicion into the public sphere as facebook twitter and instagram become increasingly theatrical  every gesture geared to impress an audience or deflect criticism  whatsapp has become a sanctuary from a confusing and untrustworthy world where users can speak more frankly as trust in groups grows so it is withdrawn from public institutions and officials a new common sense develops founded on instinctive suspicion towards the world beyond the group the ongoing rise of whatsapp and its challenge to both legacy institutions and open social media poses a profound political question how do public institutions and discussions retain legitimacy and trust once people are organised into closed and invisible communities the risk is that a vicious circle ensues in which private groups circulate ever more information and disinformation to discredit public officials and public information and our alienation from democracy escalates    when whatsapp was bought by facebook in  for bn it was the most valuable tech acquisition in history at the time whatsapp brought  million users with it in february this year it hit  billion users worldwide  and that is even before its lockdown surge  making it by far the most widely used messenger app and the second most commonly used app after facebook itself in many countries it is now the default means of digital communication and social coordination especially among younger people the features that would later allow whatsapp to become a conduit for conspiracy theory and political conflict were ones never integral to sms and have more in common with email the creation of groups and the ability to forward messages the ability to forward messages from one group to another  recently limited in response to covidrelated misinformation  makes for a potent informational weapon groups were initially limited in size to  people but this was later increased to  thats small enough to feel exclusive but if  people forward a message on to another  people  will have received it groups originate for all sorts of purposes  a party organising amateur sport a shared interest  but then take on a life of their own there can be an anarchic playfulness about this as a group takes on its own set of injokes and traditions in a new york magazine piece last year under the headline group chats are making the internet fun again the technology critic max read argued that groups have become an outright replacement for the defining mode of social organization of the past decade the platformcentric feedbased social network its understandable that in order to relax users need to know theyre not being overheard  though there is a less playful side to this if groups are perceived as a place to say what you really think away from the constraints of public judgement or political correctness then it follows that they are also where people turn to share prejudices or more hateful expressions that are unacceptable or even illegal elsewhere santiago abascal the leader of the spanish farright party vox has defined his party as one willing to defend what spaniards say on whatsapp     a whatsapp newspaper ad in india warning about fake information on its service photograph prakash singhafpgetty images    a different type of group emerges where its members are all users of the same service such as a school a housing block or a training programme a potential problem here is one of negative solidarity in which feelings of community are deepened by turning against the service in question groups of this sort typically start from a desire to pool information  students staying in touch about deadlines say  but can swiftly become a means of discrediting the institution they cluster around initial murmurs of dissatisfaction can escalate rapidly until the group has forged an identity around a spirit of resentment and alienation which can then be impossible to dislodge with countervailing evidence faced with the rise of new technologies one option for formal organisations and associations is to follow people to their preferred platform in march the government introduced a whatsappbased information service about covid with an automated chatbot but groups themselves can be an unreliable means of getting crucial information to people anecdotal evidence from local political organisers and trade union reps suggests that despite the initial efficiency of whatsapp groups their workload often increases because of the escalating number of subcommunities each of which needs to be contacted separately schools desperately seek to get information out to parents only to discover that unless it appears in precisely the right whatsapp group it doesnt register the age of the message board be it physical or digital where information can be posted once for anyone who needs it is over whatsapps broadcast list function which allows messages to be sent to multiple recipients who are invisible to one another like emails bcc line alleviates some of the problems of groups taking on a life of their own but even then lists can only include people who are already mutual contacts of the listowner the problem from the point of view of institutions is that whatsapp use seems fuelled by a preference for informal private communication as such university lecturers are frequently baffled by the discovery that many students and applicants dont read email if email is going into decline whatsapp does not seem to be a viable alternative when it comes to sharing verified information as widely and inclusively as possible groups are great for brief bursts of humour or frustration but by their very nature far less useful for supporting the circulation of public information to understand why this is the case we have to think about the way in which individuals can become swayed and influenced once they belong to a group    the internet has brought with it its own litany of social pathologies and threats trolling flaming doxing cancelling and pileons are all risks that go with socialising within a vast open architecture open platforms such as twitter are reminders that much social activity tends to be aimed at a small and select community but can be rendered comical or shameful when exposed to a different community altogether as any frequent user of whatsapp or a closed facebook group will recognise the moral anxiety associated with groups is rather different if the worry in an open network is of being judged by some outside observer be it ones boss or an extended family member in a closed group it is of saying something that goes against the codes that anchor the groups identity groups can rapidly become dominated by a certain tone or worldview that is uncomfortable to challenge and nighimpossible to dislodge whatsapp is a machine for generating feelings of faux pas as comments linger in a groups feed waiting for a response this means that while groups can generate high levels of solidarity which can in principle be put to powerful political effect it also becomes harder to express disagreement within the group if for example an outspoken and popular member of a neighbourhood whatsapp group begins to circulate misinformation about health risks the general urge to maintain solidarity means that their messages are likely to be met with approval and thanks when a claim or piece of content shows up in a group there may be many members who view it as dubious the question is whether they have the confidence to say as much meanwhile the less sceptical can simply forward it on its not hard then to understand why whatsapp is a powerful distributor of fake news and conspiracy theories as on open social platforms one of the chief ways of building solidarity on whatsapp is to posit some injustice or enemy that threatens the group and its members in the most acute examples conspiracy theories are unleashed against political opponents to the effect that they are paedophiles or secret affiliates of foreign powers such plausibly deniable practices swirled around the fringes of the successful election campaigns of modi bolsonaro and donald trump and across multiple platforms     a security message on whatsapp photograph thomas whitereuters    but what makes whatsapp potentially more dangerous than public social media are the higher levels of trust and honesty that are often present in private groups it is a truism that nobody is as happy as they appear on facebook as attractive as they appear on instagram or as angry as they appear on twitter which spawns a growing weariness with such endless performance by contrast closed groups are where people take off their public masks and let their critical guard down neither anonymity a precondition of most trolling nor celebrity are on offer the speed with which rumours circulate on whatsapp is partly a reflection of how altruistic and uncritical people can be in groups most of the time people seem to share false theories about covid not with the intention of doing harm but precisely out of concern for other group members antivaxx antig or antihillary rumours combine an identification of an enemy with a strong internal sense of solidarity nevertheless they add to the sense that the world is hostile and dangerous there is one particular pattern of a group chat that can manufacture threats and injustices out of thin air it tends to start with one participant speculating that they are being let down or targeted by some institution or rival group  be it a public service business or cultural community  whereupon a second participant agrees by this stage it becomes risky for anyone else to defend the institution or group in question and immediately a new enemy and a new resentment is born instantly the warnings and denunciations emanating from within the group take on a level of authenticity that cannot be matched by the entity that is now the object of derision but what if the first contributor has misunderstood or misread something or had a very stressful day and needs to let off steam and what if the second is merely agreeing so as to make the first one feel better and what if the other members are either too distracted too inhibited or too exhausted to say anything to oppose this fresh indignation this neednt snowball into the forms of conspiracy theory that produce riots or arson attacks but even in milder forms it makes the job of communicating official information  occasionally lifesaving information  far more troublesome than it was just a decade ago information about public services and health risks is increasingly having to penetrate a thicket of overlapping groups many of which may have developed an instinctive scepticism to anything emanating from the mainstream part of the challenge for institutions is that there is often a strange emotional comfort in the shared feeling of alienation and passivity we were never informed about that nobody consulted us we are being ignored these are dominant expressions of our political zeitgeist as whatsapp has become an increasingly common way of encountering information and news a vicious circle can ensue the public world seems ever more distant impersonal and fake and the private group becomes a space of sympathy and authenticity this is a new twist in the evolution of the social internet since the s the internet has held out a promise of connectivity openness and inclusion only to then confront inevitable threats to privacy security and identity by contrast groups make people feel secure and anchored but also help to fragment civil society into separate cliques unknown to one another this is the outcome of more than  years of ideological battles over what sort of social space the internet should be    for a few years at the dawn of the millennium the oreilly emerging technology conferences or etech were a crucible in which a new digital world was imagined and debated launched by the west coast media entrepreneur tim oreilly and hosted annually around california the conferences attracted a mixture of geeks gurus designers and entrepreneurs brought together more in a spirit of curiosity than of commerce in  oreilly coined the term web  to describe a new wave of websites that connected users with each other rather than with existing offline institutions later that year the domain name facebookcom was purchased by a yearold harvard student and the age of the giant social media platforms was born within this short window of time we can see competing ideas of what a desirable online community might look like the more idealistic tech gurus who attended etech insisted that the internet should remain an open public space albeit one in which select communities could cluster for their own particular purposes such as creating opensource software projects or wikipedia entries the untapped potential of the internet they believed was for greater democracy but for companies such as facebook the internet presented an opportunity to collect data about users en masse the internets potential was for greater surveillance the rise of the giant platforms from  onwards suggested the latter view had won out and yet in a strange twist we are now witnessing a revival of anarchic selforganising digital groups  only now in the hands of facebook as well the two competing visions have collided     mark zuckerberg talking about privacy at a facebook conference in  photograph amy osborneafpgetty images    to see how this story unfolded its worth going back to  at the etech conference that year a keynote speech was given by the web enthusiast and writer clay shirky now an academic at new york university which surprised its audience by declaring that the task of designing successful online communities had little to do with technology at all the talk looked back at one of the most fertile periods in the history of social psychology and was entitled a group is its own worst enemy shirky drew on the work of the british psychoanalyst and psychologist wilfred bion who together with kurt lewin was one of the pioneers of the study of group dynamics in the s the central proposition of this school was that groups possess psychological properties that exist independently of their individual members in groups people find themselves behaving in ways that they never would if left to their own devices like stanley milgrams notorious series of experiments to test obedience in the early s  in which some participants were persuaded to administer apparently painful electric shocks to others  the midth century concern with group dynamics grew in the shadow of the political horrors of the s and s which had posed grave questions about how individuals come to abandon their ordinary sense of morality lewin and bion posited that groups possess distinctive personalities which emerge organically through the interaction of their members independently of what rules they might have been given or what individuals might rationally do alone with the dawn of the s and its more individualistic political hopes psychologists interest in groups started to wane the assumption that individuals are governed by conformity fell by the wayside when shirky introduced bions work at the oreilly conference in  he was going out on a limb what he correctly saw was that in the absence of any explicit structures or rules online communities were battling against many of the disruptive dynamics that fascinated the psychologists of the s shirky highlighted one area of bions work in particular how groups can spontaneously sabotage their own stipulated purpose the beauty of early online communities such as listservs message boards and wikis was their spirit of egalitarianism humour and informality but these same properties often worked against them when it came to actually getting anything constructive done and could sometimes snowball into something obstructive or angry once the mood of a group was diverted towards jokes disruption or hostility towards another group it became very difficult to wrest it back bions concerns originated in fear of humanitys darker impulses but the vision shirky was putting to his audience that day was a more optimistic one if the designers of online spaces could preempt disruptive group dynamics he argued then it might be possible to support cohesive productive online communities that remained open and useful at the same time like a well designed park or street a welldesigned online space might nurture healthy sociability without the need for policing surveillance or closure to outsiders between one extreme of anarchic chaos constant trolling and another of strict moderation and regulation of discussion acceding to an authority figure thinking in terms of group dynamics held out the promise of a social web that was still largely selforganising but also relatively orderly but there was another solution to this same problem waiting in the wings which would turn out to be worldchanging in its consequences forget group dynamics and focus on reputation dynamics instead if someone online has a certain set of offline attributes such as a job title an album of tagged photos a list of friends and an email address they will behave themselves in ways that are appropriate to all of these fixed public identifiers add more and more surveillance into the mix both by ones peers and by corporations and the problem of spontaneous group dynamics disappears it is easier to hold on to your selfcontrol and your conscience if you are publicly visible including to friends extended family and colleagues for many of the californian pioneers of cyberculture who cherished online communities as an escape from the values and constraints of capitalist society zuckerbergs triumph represents an unmitigated defeat corporations were never meant to seize control of this space as late as  the hope was that the social web would be built around democratic principles and bottomup communities facebook abandoned all of that by simply turning the internet into a multimedia telephone directory the last etech was held in  within a decade facebook was being accused of pushing liberal democracy to the brink and even destroying truth itself but as the demands of social media have become more onerous with each of us curating a profile and projecting an identity the lure of the autonomous group has resurfaced once again in some respects shirkys optimistic concern has now become todays pessimistic one partly thanks to whatsapp the unmoderated selfgoverning amoral collective  larger than a conversation smaller than a public  has become a dominant and disruptive political force in our society much as figures such as bion and lewin feared    conspiracy theories and paranoid group dynamics were features of political life long before whatsapp arrived it makes no sense to blame the app for their existence any more than it makes sense to blame facebook for brexit but by considering the types of behaviour and social structures that technologies enable and enhance we get a better sense of some of societys characteristics and ailments what are the general tendencies that whatsapp helps to accelerate first of all there is the problem of conspiracies in general whatsapp is certainly an unbeatable conduit for circulating conspiracy theories but we must also admit that it seems to be an excellent tool for facilitating genuinely conspiratorial behaviour one of the great difficulties when considering conspiracy theories in todays world is that regardless of whatsapp some conspiracies turn out to be true consider liborfixing phonehacking or efforts by labour party officials to thwart jeremy corbyns electoral prospects these all happened but one would have sounded like a conspiracy theorist to suggest them until they were later confirmed by evidence a communication medium that connects groups of up to  people without any public visibility operating via the phones in their pockets is by its very nature wellsuited to supporting secrecy obviously not every group chat counts as a conspiracy but it makes the question of how society coheres who is associated with whom into a matter of speculation  something that involves a trace of conspiracy theory in that sense whatsapp is not just a channel for the circulation of conspiracy theories but offers content for them as well the medium is the message the full political potential of whatsapp has not been witnessed in the uk to date it has not served as an effective political campaigning tool partly because users seem reluctant to join large groups with people they dont know however the influence  imagined or real  of whatsapp groups within westminster and the media undoubtedly contributes to the deepening sense that public life is a sham behind which lurk invisible networks through which power is coordinated whatsapp has become a kind of backstage of public life where it is assumed people articulate what they really think and believe in secret this is a sensibility that has long fuelled conspiracy theories especially antisemitic ones invisible whatsapp groups now offer a modern update to the type of explanation that once revolved around masonic lodges or the rothschilds   related why cant we agree on whats true any more    away from the world of party politics and news media there is the prospect of a society organised as a tapestry of overlapping cliques each with their own internal norms groups are less likely to encourage heterodoxy or risktaking and more likely to inculcate conformity albeit often to a set of norms hostile to those of the mainstream whether that be the media politics or professional public servants simply doing their jobs in the safety of the group it becomes possible to have ones cake and eat it to be simultaneously radical and orthodox hypersceptical and yet unreflective for all the benefits that whatsapp offers in helping people feel close to others its rapid ascendency is one further sign of how a common public world  based upon verified facts and recognised procedures  is disintegrating whatsapp is well equipped to support communications on the margins of institutions and public discussion backbenchers plotting coups parents gossipping about teachers friends sharing edgy memes journalists circulating rumours family members forwarding on unofficial medical advice a society that only speaks honestly on the margins like this will find it harder to sustain the legitimacy of experts officials and representatives who by definition operate in the spotlight meanwhile distrust alienation and conspiracy theories become the norm

      " automated facial recognition technology that searches for people in public places breaches privacy rights and will radically alter the way britain is policed the court of appeal has been told at the opening of a legal challenge against the use by south wales police of the mass surveillance system lawyers for the civil rights organisation liberty argued that it is also racially discriminatory and contrary to data protection laws in written submissions to the court dan squires qc who is acting for liberty and ed bridges a cardiff resident said that the south wales force had already captured the biometrics of  faces the overwhelming majority of whom are not suspected of any wrongdoing bridges  whose face was scanned while he was christmas shopping in cardiff in  and at a peaceful antiarms protest outside the citys motorpoint arena in  says the use of automatic facial recognition afr by south wales police caused him distress the case has been brought after south wales police and the home office won a high court case last year that effectively gave the green light for national deployment of the technology in a case focused on the potentials of digital technology the online hearing was ironically plagued by technical difficulties  muffled sounds echoing voices and disruptions to the livestreamed public service at one point while the sitting was suspended one of the three appeal court judges dame victoria sharp president of the queens bench division could be heard remarking now we know what the crown court judges feel like use of remote technology during the pandemic many lawyers feel has not been an unqualified success  in his written submission squires said if afr is rolled out nationally it will change radically the way that britain is policed  connected to a database with the right information afr could be used to identify very large numbers of people in a given place at a given time  for example those present at a protest that the police are monitoring  he added given the proliferation of databases operated by the police and other public authorities the exponential increase in information held by public bodies and the ever increasing practice of sharing that information between public bodies it is not difficult to imagine that police forces nationally could soon  if they cannot already  have access to photographs of the vast majority of the population on concerns about afrs potential for discrimination squires said there was a heightened risk of racial bias leading to erroneous police stops in order to comply with the public sector equality duty he added the police force was required to make concerted efforts to determine whether the particular afr software it was using suffered from the problems of race or gender bias identified in other software and to take reasonable steps to obtain material to enable it to make that determination correctly however squires said south wales police failed to do so  the hearing continues\n",
