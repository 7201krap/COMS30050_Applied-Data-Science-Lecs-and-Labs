anx_band_15,fh6877,Child's has any anxiety disorder (DAWBA band prediction),Ordinal,Clinic,15.5,Derived by ALSPAC. See Processing Details,,Any anxiety disorder was determined using the DAWBA. The child completed the computerised questions and an ordered categorical measure of any anxiety disorder with 6 categories was derived using computer algorithms. The categories are probability bands and indicate the likelihood of the child having any anxiety disorder. The categories range from <0.1% (0.1% children in this band have any anxiety disorder) to > 70% (>70% of children in this band have any anxiety disorder).
